# Kindred Take-Home Project: Pet Swapping Mini-App

Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to complete our take-home challenge.
This is meant to simulate a real (but lighthearted) Kindred product experience, with a twist: instead of homes, you'll be helping people find pet-sitting buddies!

## Project Brief

You'll extend a minimal experience for browsing and "booking" pets available for swapping/sitting. The goal is to showcase your frontend skills, your technical and product thinking, and your ability to communicate clearly.

You'll find boilerplate already in place for simple feed of pets - your task is to improve on what is there and make it your own. That might mean showing off your UI/UX skills and improving the existing feed, adding a new feature or screen, or even simply improving the organization and structure of the project. There's no right answer here, just an opportunity to show us your skills and what you are passionate about.

## Time Expectations

- **You should not spend more than 1-2 hours on this project.**
- Please don't over-engineer or polish beyond that.
- If you run over, just note what you'd do with more time in your submission.

---

## Requirements

### **Functional**

1. **Pet List**

   - Fetch a list of pets from the mock API (`GET /api/pets`).
   - Display pet info: photo, name, species, city, and status.
   - Indicate if the pet is "booked" or "available."

2. **Booking Action**

   - Allow users to "Book" an available pet.
   - Simulate booking with `POST /api/book/:petId` (just fake the call and update UI).

## About Using AI

- You **may use AI/code assistants** to help you, but _you_ should own and understand all code.
- Please note in your submission if/where you used AI to assist.
- Do not copy-paste full, unedited AI-generated screens or logic that you can not explain yourelf.

---

## What to Submit

- Push your code to your assignment repo.
- **Update this README** with:

  - Your approach and any tradeoffs.
  - Time spent.
  - Where/if you used AI.
  - (If needed) What you'd do with more time.

- Optional: You may submit a screenshare walkthrough of your code if you'd prefer.

## Getting Started

### **Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### **Start the mock API**

```bash
cd mock-api
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

This starts the JSON server at `http://localhost:3001`.

### **Run the Web App**

```bash
cd web
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

**Thanks and have fun with it!**
If you get stuck or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your recruiter.

### Approach
- Split pets into Available and Booked to help draw more attention to available Pets
   - Tradeoff: This unfortunately doesn't have the greatest UX as it will preserve the ordering of the original array and not have a Queue-like feel to it. 
      To address that, we can use two separate arrays to manage available/booked but this will require more state management and computation.
- Add a waitlist button to Booked pets to add some UI to the booked pets
   - This is extremely barebones and does not have any userId handling and is essentially an incremental counter
- Added a small loading state in between booking and waitlisting

### Time Spent
- 1 hour

### AI
- None

### More Time
- Improve waitlist functionality
- change to a carousel for the images to prevent overflow if there are more items
- add Pet product page to show more details after clicking on the card
- add filtering
